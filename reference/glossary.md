# Terms & Definitions

Words and concepts I'm learning. Adding to this as I go.



## Basic Stuff I Already Know

**AI (Artificial Intelligence)**  
Computer systems that can do tasks that usually need human intelligence

**LLM (Large Language Model)**  
AI trained on tons of text data. Like GPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.

**API (Application Programming Interface)**  
Way for different programs to talk to each other. How I'll use Gemini.

**Prompt**  
The text you give to an AI to tell it what to do

**Token**  
Small chunks of text the AI processes. Usually ~4 characters per token



## Agent-Specific Terms

**AI Agent**  
*will define this properly after day 1*

**Multi-agent system**  
*day 2*

**Tool use / Function calling**  
*day 3*

**RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**  
*day 3 probably*

**Agent orchestration**  
*day 2*

**Context window**  
*need to understand this better*



## Technical Terms

**Jupyter Notebook**  
Interactive coding environment. What we're using on Kaggle.

**Virtual environment (venv)**  
Isolated Python setup so packages don't conflict

**Git / GitHub**  
Version control. Tracking changes to code.

**Environment variables**  
Secret values (like API keys) stored outside code
