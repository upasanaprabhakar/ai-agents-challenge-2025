# 🚀 5-Day AI Agents Intensive | My Learning Journey

> Building intelligent AI agents with Google Gemini - Nov 10-15, 2025

Hey! This is my personal workspace for Google and Kaggle's AI Agents Challenge. I'm documenting everything I learn about building production-ready AI agents here. Feel free to follow along!

---

## What's This About?

I'm participating in a 5-day intensive where I'll learn to build AI agents from scratch. Think of it as a deep dive into making AI systems that can actually *do things* - not just answer questions, but use tools, remember context, and work together.

**The Challenge:** Nov 10-15, 2025  
**Where:** Kaggle platform with live YouTube sessions  
**What:** Hands-on coding with Google's Gemini API

---

## What I'm Learning

Here's the breakdown of what I'll be working through:

**Day 1 (Nov 10)** - Getting started with agent basics and Gemini API  
**Day 2 (Nov 11)** - Designing multi-agent systems and orchestration  
**Day 3 (Nov 12)** - Adding tools and memory to agents  
**Day 4 (Nov 13)** - Testing, evaluation, and making things scale  
**Day 5 (Nov 14-15)** - Building my final capstone project

## My Daily Workflow

This is how I'm approaching each session:

1. Join the live stream and follow along
2. Complete the day's Kaggle notebook
3. Write down what I learned in `my-notes.md`
4. Try building something extra in the `practice/` folder
5. Update my progress in `daily-log.md`
6. Push everything to GitHub

Simple but keeps me organized!

## What I'm Building

Beyond the daily lessons, I'm planning to experiment with:

- A personal assistant agent
- Some automation tools
- Maybe a multi-agent system for [your idea]

I'll keep these in the `experiments/` folder as I build them out.

## A Few Notes

This is my learning journey, so the code might not be perfect. I'm focusing on understanding concepts and building things that work. If you spot something that could be better, feel free to open an issue or drop a comment!

Also, I'm documenting everything as I learn it, so my understanding (and this repo) will evolve throughout the week.
