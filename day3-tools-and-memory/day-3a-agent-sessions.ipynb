This is significantly faster and cheaper than developing a drug from scratch.\n*   **Recent News Highlight:** AI has been instrumental in identifying existing drugs that could be repurposed for emerging infectious diseases or for conditions with limited treatment options.\n\n**Examples of AI in Drug Discovery Companies/Initiatives:**\n\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** Known for its \"end-to-end\" AI platform for drug discovery, they have had several AI-discovered drugs enter clinical trials.\n*   **Exscientia:** Focuses on using AI to design new molecules and optimize them for clinical development.\n*   **Atomwise:** Uses deep learning for structure-based drug design and discovery.\n*   **NVIDIA:** While a hardware company, NVIDIA provides the computational power and software platforms (like Clara Discovery) that enable many of these AI drug discovery efforts.\n\n**Challenges and the Future:**\n\nDespite the rapid progress, challenges remain:\n\n*   **Data quality and standardization:** AI models are only as good as the data they're trained on.\n*   **Experimental validation:** AI predictions still require rigorous laboratory and clinical testing.\n*   **Regulatory hurdles:** Ensuring AI-discovered drugs meet safety and efficacy standards.\n*   **Interpretability:** Understanding *why* an AI model makes certain predictions is crucial for trust and refinement.\n\nHowever, the trend is clear: AI is no longer a futuristic concept in drug discovery; it's an integral part of the process, dramatically shortening timelines, reducing costs, and opening up new possibilities for treating diseases. The next few years will likely see many more AI-discovered and developed drugs reaching patients.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the **second major development in AI for drug discovery** that I mentioned: **Revolutionizing Molecule Design and Synthesis.** This is a particularly exciting area because it's where AI is actively *creating* new potential medicines.\n\nLet's dive deeper into what this entails:\n\n**The Core Idea: AI as a Creative Chemist**\n\nTraditionally, drug discovery involved chemists synthesizing and testing thousands, even millions, of compounds. This was a slow, iterative process often relying on intuition and existing chemical libraries.\n\nAI is fundamentally changing this by acting as an incredibly powerful and creative \"digital chemist.\" It can:\n\n*   **Explore Vast Chemical Space:** The number of possible molecules is astronomically large. AI, especially through **generative models**, can navigate this space much more efficiently than humans.\n*   **Design Molecules with Specific Properties:** Instead of randomly searching, AI can be tasked with designing molecules that are predicted to bind strongly to a specific disease target, have good absorption in the body, and low toxicity.\n*   **Optimize Existing Molecules:** If a promising but imperfect drug candidate is found, AI can suggest modifications to improve its performance.\n\n**Key AI Technologies Involved:**\n\n1.  **Generative AI Models:** These are the stars of this development. They learn the underlying \"rules\" of chemistry and biology from vast datasets and can then generate entirely new, never-before-seen molecules. Common types include:\n    *   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** Learn a compressed representation of molecules and can then sample from this representation to generate new ones.\n    *   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Two neural networks compete – one generates molecules, and the other tries to distinguish them from real molecules. This process pushes the generator to create highly realistic and novel structures.\n    *   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Can be used to guide the generation process towards molecules that meet specific criteria (e.g., high binding affinity, desired solubility).\n    *   **Large Language Models (LLMs) adapted for chemistry:** Similar to how LLMs generate text, these models can generate molecular structures (often represented as SMILES strings or other chemical notations).\n\n2.  **Predictive AI Models (Machine Learning):** These models are crucial for evaluating the generated molecules. They predict various properties without the need for actual lab synthesis:\n    *   **Binding Affinity Prediction:** How strongly will the molecule bind to its target protein?\n    *   **ADMET Prediction:** Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity. This is vital for understanding how a drug will behave in the body and if it's likely to cause harmful side effects.\n    *   **Synthesizability Prediction:** Can this molecule actually be made in a lab efficiently?\n\n**How it Works in Practice (Simplified Workflow):**\n\n1.  **Define the Target:** Researchers identify a specific protein or pathway involved in a disease.\n2.  **Set Design Constraints:** Define desired properties for the drug molecule (e.g., target binding, solubility, no known toxicophores).\n3.  **AI Generates Candidates:** A generative AI model proposes a library of novel molecular structures that are predicted to meet these criteria.\n4.  **AI Evaluates Candidates:** Predictive AI models analyze each generated molecule for its likely efficacy, safety, and synthesizability.\n5.  **Iterative Refinement:** The top candidates are selected. Chemists might then perform some experimental validation, and this feedback can be used to further train and refine the AI models for the next round of generation.\n6.  **Lab Synthesis and Testing:** The most promising AI-designed molecules are synthesized and tested in the lab and eventually in clinical trials.\n\n**Recent Progress and Significance:**\n\n*   **Speed:** AI can design and propose thousands of viable candidates in days or weeks, compared to months or years previously.\n*   **Novelty:** AI can explore chemical structures that might not have been considered by human intuition.\n*   **Efficiency:** By predicting properties and synthesizability early, AI helps filter out unpromising candidates, saving immense resources.\n*   **\"In Silico\" First Pass:** Many molecules are evaluated and refined entirely \"in silico\" (on a computer) before any expensive lab work begins.\n\n**Examples of Progress:**\n\n*   **AI-designed drugs entering clinical trials:** Companies like Exscientia, Insilico Medicine, and Recursion Pharmaceuticals have AI-designed molecules that have advanced to human testing for various conditions, including cancer, fibrosis, and neurodegenerative diseases. This is a major milestone – moving from concept to real-world testing.\n*   **Improving existing drug discovery processes:** Even for drugs not entirely designed by AI, AI tools are used to optimize lead compounds, making them more effective and safer.\n*   **Democratization of drug design:** While requiring significant expertise, AI tools are making sophisticated molecular design more accessible to a wider range of researchers.\n\nThis development is truly transformative because it addresses the \"discovery\" bottleneck – finding the right starting point for a new medicine. It's an area that is seeing intense research, investment, and tangible results, making it a cornerstone of AI's impact on healthcare.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the key players in the AI-driven molecule design and synthesis space.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
