Imagine a world where complex tasks are broken down into smaller, independent, and intelligent components that collaborate seamlessly. Welcome to the realm of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), and it's time developers discovered their transformative potential.\n\n### Main Section 1: Enhanced Modularity and Maintainability\n*   **Decomposition of Complexity:** MAS allows developers to break down large, intricate problems into smaller, self-contained agents, each responsible for a specific function or aspect of the system. This makes the overall architecture easier to understand and manage.\n*   **Independent Development and Testing:** Individual agents can be developed, tested, and debugged in isolation. This significantly speeds up the development cycle and reduces the risk of introducing bugs into unrelated parts of the system.\n*   **Easier Updates and Replacements:** Need to update or replace a specific piece of functionality? With MAS, you can often modify or swap out individual agents without affecting the entire system, leading to greater agility and flexibility.\n\n### Main Section 2: Improved Scalability and Resilience\n*   **Distributed Problem Solving:** MAS inherently supports distributed computing. Agents can operate on different machines or processes, allowing for horizontal scaling to handle increasing workloads and user demands.\n*   **Fault Tolerance:** If one agent fails, the system can often continue to operate with reduced functionality or other agents can take over its responsibilities. This makes MAS more robust and less prone to single points of failure.\n*   **Dynamic Adaptation:** Agents can be designed to adapt to changing environments or requirements. New agents can be introduced, or existing ones modified, to respond to evolving needs without requiring a complete system overhaul.\n\n### Main Section 3: Intelligent Automation and Collaboration\n*   **Autonomous Decision-Making:** Agents can be programmed with varying degrees of autonomy, enabling them to make decisions and take actions based on their local knowledge and goals, reducing the need for constant human intervention.\n*   **Complex Task Orchestration:** MAS excels at orchestrating complex tasks that involve multiple steps and dependencies. Agents can communicate and coordinate their actions to achieve a common objective efficiently.\n*   **Learning and Adaptation:** Advanced MAS can incorporate machine learning capabilities, allowing agents to learn from their experiences, optimize their behavior, and improve system performance over time.\n\n### Main Section 4: New Paradigms for Software Design\n*   **Shift from Procedural to Agent-Based Thinking:** MAS encourages a shift in mindset, moving away from rigid, procedural programming towards a more flexible, emergent design based on interaction and collaboration.\n*   **Modeling Real-World Systems:** The agent-based approach often mirrors real-world systems more closely, making it ideal for applications in areas like simulation, robotics, supply chain management, and complex adaptive systems.\n*   **Potential for Emergent Behavior:** While challenging to control, the emergent behavior of MAS can lead to novel and unexpected solutions, pushing the boundaries of what software can achieve.\n\n### Concluding Thought:\nEmbracing multi-agent systems isn't just about adopting a new technology; it's about unlocking a more powerful and adaptable way of building software. For developers willing to explore this paradigm, the rewards in terms of scalability, resilience, and intelligent automation are immense. So, are you ready to give your software development a superpower upgrade?\nWriterAgent > ## Unleash Superpowers: How Multi-Agent Systems Can Revolutionize Your Development Workflow\n\nAre you tired of monolithic codebases that are difficult to manage, scale, and debug?

You've seen how parallel agents can dramatically speed up workflows by running independent tasks concurrently.\n\nSo far, all our workflows run from start to finish and then stop. **But what if you need to review and improve an output multiple times?** Next, we'll build a workflow that can loop and refine its own work.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n## ➰ Section 5: Loop Workflows - The Refinement Cycle\n\n**The Problem: One-Shot Quality**\n\nAll the workflows we've seen so far run from start to finish. The `SequentialAgent` and `ParallelAgent` produce their final output and then stop. This 'one-shot' approach isn't good for tasks that require refinement and quality control. What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\",  # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-13T17:47:33.489575Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-13T17:47:33.489890Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-13T17:47:33.495589Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-13T17:47:33.489858Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-13T17:47:33.494842Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":22},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.

Explore this feeling further. What specific emotions does Elias experience upon discovering the map? Is it excitement, fear, longing, or a mix? Showing these internal reactions will make him a more relatable character.\n*   **Foreshadow or hint at the map's origin/purpose:** The map is a magical artifact, but its origin and purpose are currently unknown. You could add a subtle hint early on, perhaps in the way Elias polishes the lens, or a strange occurrence he's witnessed before, that might connect to the map's discovery.

For thirty years, this tower had been his world, the ceaseless roar of the ocean his only companion. He’d grown accustomed to the rhythmic crash of waves, the cry of gulls, the scent of damp stone and sea air. But tonight, a peculiar stillness hung in the air, a silence that seemed to amplify the ocean's usual song. A faint shimmer beneath a pile of old, brine-stained logbooks caught his eye, an unusual glimmer against the familiar worn leather.\n\nHe brushed away the dust, his calloused fingers expecting the rough texture of parchment.

A jolt, not entirely unpleasant, shot through him as his skin made contact with the pulsing X. It felt like a whisper of static electricity, a momentary quickening of his pulse.

A strange mix of trepidation and an exhilarating, long-dormant hope bloomed in his chest. He remembered, with a sudden clarity, the unusual aurora he’d witnessed a month ago, a silent, dancing light that had painted the sky in hues of impossible green and blue—the same colors, he now realized, as the map’s glow.
